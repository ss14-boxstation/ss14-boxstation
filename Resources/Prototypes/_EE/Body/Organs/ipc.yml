  # The following was already commented out on DeltaV
  # The heart 'metabolizes' medicines and poisons that aren't filtered out by other organs.
  # This is done because these chemicals need to have some effect even if they aren't being filtered out of your body.
  # You're technically 'immune to poison' without a heart, but.. uhh, you'll have bigger problems on your hands.
