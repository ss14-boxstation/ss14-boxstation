  # I.P.C.
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobIPCDummy" Caption="I.P.C."/>
  An IPC (short for Integrated Positronic Chassis) is a type of sentient robot and is considered an [color=yellow]independent individual[/color], meaning [color=red]they are not guided by any laws of robotics[/color]. IPCs cannot be hacked by Emags because they do not have to follow any predefined directives in their system. [color=red]IPCs are silicon-based beings, so they are healed differently to organic species.[/color]

  They take [color=#1e90ff]50% less Radiation damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]50% more Heat damage, and 100% more Shock Damage.[/color] As they are Inorganic, they do not take Poison, Asphyxiation, Bloodloss, or Genetic damage, and Cannot Metabolize Reagents.

  An IPC's punch deals 6 blunt damage.

  ## Recharging an IPC

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PowerCellMedium" Caption="Power Cell"/>
  </Box>
  IPCs can be recharged in three different ways:

  [bold]APC Terminal:[/bold] IPCs can use APC terminals to recharge. Press [color=yellow]Alt + left click[/color] on a terminal as many times as needed to fully recharge.

  [bold]Borg Rechargers:[/bold] IPCs can use borg rechargers to recharge. Always prioritize the ones outside of the Sci area to avoid headaches.

  [bold]Power Cell:[/bold] IPCs have an internal power cell that serves as their battery. They can simply swap it out by opening the hatch and manually replacing it.

  ## Repairing
    IPCs can be repaired by a wide variety of tools, depending on the damage. The station's Medical bay should have these tools on hand.

    In the event an IPC dies, after being fully repaired, it should be restarted using the [color=yellow]"Restart"[/color] button (located by right-clicking).

    [color=red][bold]NEVER ELECTROCUTE AN IPC with a defibrillator[/bold] or in any other way while it is dead, as this will cause the battery to discharge energy rays outward![/color]

  ### Basic Tools
    Basic Tools are more common with Medical starting with a healthy supply of them and some starting in an IPCs [color=yellow]Survival Kit[/color].

    These are simple and useable options, however they lack the potency of the Advanced Tools.

  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WelderIndustrialAdvanced" Caption="Welder"/>
    Welders can be used to repair [color=yellow]Minor Brute Damage[/color], alongside [color=yellow]Miniscule Cold Damage[/color]. They can be found in Tools, Maintenance Tunnels, and in the hands of Station Engineers and Roboticists. Welding without eye protection causes [color=yellow]Blindness[/color], even to IPCs.

    Chassis Patches stop [color=yellow]Bleeding[/color] and heal [color=yellow]Piercing Damage[/color], [color=yellow]Minor Slash Damage[/color], and [color=yellow]Miniscule Blunt Damage[/color]. They can be crafted with Durathread and Steel by hand or in the Medical TechFab. Durathread is made with Plastic and Cloth.

    IPC Oil Packs [color=yellow]Replenish the Bloodstream[/color] of an IPC with specialized Coolant and Lubricant, and heal [color=yellow]Miniscule Heat Damage[/color] and [color=yellow]Miniscule Blunt Damage[/color]. They can be made in a Microwave with specific reagents.
  </Box>

  ### Specialized
  Specialized Tools tackle more complex damage, and are thus harder to obtain. They cannot be found naturally on the Station and must be crafted to meet demand.

  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComponentPack" Caption="Component Replacement Kits"/>
    Component Replacement Kits heal [color=yellow] Major Radiation Damage[/color] alongside [color=yellow]Shock Damage[/color].
  </Box>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ReplacementLenses" Caption="Replacement Lenses"/>
    Replacement Lenses can be used to repair [color=yellow]Blindness[/color]. They can be made in the Medical Techfab.
  </Box>
  ### Advanced Tools
  All Advanced Tools require advanced medicinal reagents, and provide the most healing of all IPC Repair Tools. The tools that heal one damage at a time are the most effective, with Omni Patches being the most effective for all damages.

  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Stretch">
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OmniPatch" Caption="Omni Patches"/>
    Omni Patches heal [color=yellow]All Damage[/color], as well as [color=yellow]Replenishing the Bloodstream[/color] and stopping [color=yellow]Bleeding[/color]. They can also be obtained from a Syndicate Agent's Uplink.
