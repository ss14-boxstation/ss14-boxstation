  Vulpkanin, due to their dense fur, are [color=#1e90ff]more resistant to cold temperatures[/color] and [color=#ffa500]heat up faster.[/color]
  Their agile (but clumsy) legs allow them to leap short distances, be careful not to bump into anything!

  Their weirdly shaped muzzle leads to difficulties drinking, making them sometimes spill small amounts of whatever they drank onto the ground.

  Thanks to their good sense of smell, they are able to determine the contents of solutions without the need for any specialized equipment.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]15% less Cold damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]15% more Heat damage.[/color].
